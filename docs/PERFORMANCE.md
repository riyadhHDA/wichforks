# Performance reports

Hardware, game, build and FPS reports collected from public community reports and the Orchid README. These are user reports, not benchmarks. The same GPU can produce very different numbers with another driver, game version, settings or shader cache.

Charts and the game-by-setup coverage matrix are in [coverage](COVERAGE.md). The normalized data is in [`data/performance-reports.json`](../data/performance-reports.json). The first-pick recommendations use the 3-6 Nov 2026 window and the newest builds; older rows are historical context.

`Not stated` means the report did not include that field. `Unspecified` means no build number was given. Rows are grouped by game, with the most complete configs first.

These tables are not a GPU ranking. A faster GPU can lose to a slower one when the CPU or build is the bottleneck, and AMD rows include rendering bugs that are not raw performance.

## What the reports suggest

- CPU single-core speed matters a lot. OoT remake runs at 54-60 FPS on a 9800X3D, 20-24 FPS on an i3-10100, and an RTX 2070 with a 9800X3D beats a 7900 XTX with a 13400F.
- Build choice can double performance. Mario Kart World went from about 23 FPS on build 122 to 40+ FPS on build 135 for one tester.
- Compatibility fixes are not the same as speed. PokeDinner documents DK rendering fixes; recent independent DK reports favor Selevet and PokeDinner 2.5, while ZendNevs numbers are self-reported.
- 8 GB of RAM can boot a game, but it crashes when other apps use memory. 16 GB is a practical floor, 32 GB is safer.
- 4 GB of VRAM can run games at low settings; 6 GB and up is more comfortable at higher resolution.
- A fast GPU alone does not guarantee 60 FPS. Emulator builds and drivers decide a large part of the result.

## Mario Kart World

MKW has its own page because the report volume is much larger: [Mario Kart World notes](MKW.md). It covers settings, build regressions and nearly 50 configs.

A few representative rows:

| Build | CPU | GPU | RAM | Performance | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v2.0.5 | 5500X3D | RTX 4070 | 16 GB | 56 FPS average, 44-50 in the lowest 10% | 1x handheld, DynamicFPS; not locked 60 | ZendNevs release notes |
| Orchid v0.7.2 | 5800X3D | RX 9070 XT | 32 GB | 30-40 FPS | Linux, Mesa RADV git; asset glitches | Orchid README |
| build 122 to 135 | R5 7600 | RX 7800 XT | not stated | 23 average to 40+ FPS | Windows 11 | Community, 2 Nov |

## Splatoon Raiders

| Build | CPU | GPU | RAM | Performance | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0-rc1 PGO | i7-4790K | GTX 980 4 GB | 32 GB DDR3 2133 | about 50 FPS in the first hub after shaders | 1.0 scale, fast, Vulkan; 2.3 GB VRAM | Community, 5 Nov |
| unspecified | Steam Deck APU | Steam Deck APU | 16 GB | playable with lighting bugs | better than MKW at 15-20 FPS | Community, 1-2 Nov |

## Pokemon Pokopia

Pokopia has its own page because the workarounds matter: [Pokopia notes](POKOPIA.md). It covers the black sky, the 120fps mod, memory limits and 15 configs.

A few representative rows:

| Build | CPU | GPU | RAM | Performance | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v2.0.5 | 5500X3D | RTX 4070 | 16 GB | 60 FPS game, 116-120 display with frame generation | startup test only, about one minute | ZendNevs release notes |
| notsapinho | 12th-gen i5 2.5 GHz | RTX 4060 Mobile 6 GB | 16 GB | 80+ FPS | accurate, docked, 120fps mod | Community, 4 Nov |

| Steam Deck | Steam Deck APU | Steam Deck APU | 16 GB | 30-40 FPS, later 25-30 | uneven frame pacing | Community, 2 Nov |

## Donkey Kong Bananza

DK has its own page because the workarounds matter as much as the FPS: [Donkey Kong Bananza notes](DONKEY-KONG.md). It covers the 30 FPS cap, DynamicFPS, terrain and purple-screen issues, and about 20 configs.

A few representative rows:

| Build | CPU | GPU | RAM | Performance | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ZendNevs v2.0.5 | 5500X3D | RTX 4070 | 16 GB | 33 FPS average, 20.6 low, 99% game speed | 1x handheld; v2.0.1 gave 40 FPS at 83% speed | ZendNevs release notes |
| PokeDinner 2.5 | Ryzen 5 9600X | RX 6800 16 GB | 16 GB DDR5 | 30 FPS option, no glitches, smooth | full AMD system | Community, 4 Nov |
| Selevet perf 3 | 5700X3D | RTX 5070 Ti | 32 GB | 30 FPS cap, 60 with smooth motion | default 0.5x, 1x works | Community, 1 Nov |
| v0.1.0-rc1 PGO | 7700X | RX 7900 XTX | not stated | 30+ FPS, purple screen absent, music and rumble present | Linux Nobara | Community, 5 Nov |

## Yoshi and the Mysterious Book

| Build | CPU | GPU | RAM | Performance | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0-rc1 PGO | 7700X | RX 7900 XTX | not stated | 45-60 FPS, green glitch, cutscene skipped, hard crash on Plasma/X11 | Linux Nobara | Community, 5 Nov |
| 202 | 7700X | RX 7900 XTX | not stated | choppy, loads the cutscene | Linux Nobara | Community, 4 Nov |
| unspecified | not stated | not stated | not stated | reports 60 FPS but the screen stays black outside menus | audio works | Community, 3 Nov |

## Zelda: Ocarina of Time remake

The field reports below use Lichii build 80 unless noted. Build 88 or newer is the current recommendation, but most community numbers still come from build 80. For the complete experimental setup guide (including AMD CheezerWheezer builds, precompiled 76K shader cache installation, and nx2_switches configuration), see [Ocarina of Time notes](OOT.md). The larger public Lichii dataset is in [Lichii reports](LICHII-REPORTS.md): 155 of its 202 reports are OoT.

OoT is capped at 30 FPS without the Dynamic FPS mod. Build 88 bundles Dark's Dynamic FPS mod for OoT, enabled by default; frame pacing and game speed still need testing, and shader compilation remains the main cause of stutter.

Build 75 first got OoT in-game at 12-22 FPS on a Ryzen 9 5900X and RTX 3080, with heavy fog and glow. Build 88 integrated Frizti's performance ports and a bundled Dynamic FPS mod; the developer reports 60 FPS, and outlets and users saw 60 FPS in opening areas on RTX 4080/5080/5090. Build 93 added AMD shader and Vulkan synchronization fixes, but they have not been verified in affected AMD gameplay. Build 94/95 fixes OoT foliage, white flashes, terrain overdraw, the reticle and several rejected shaders, with limited gameplay testing. Radeon black screens and driver crashes remain the main blocker.

Orchid v0.7.3 and v0.7.4 fix OoT exposure, fog and vegetation. There is no OoT FPS report for Orchid yet. A community comment that called performance questionable also said the build had not been tried.

## Corrections

- Donkey Kong Bananza: PokeDinner was the first pick because its release notes target DK rendering. That is compatibility work, not a performance result. ZendNevs documents about 33 FPS average at 99% game speed, and community feedback says it is the better DK pick. The first pick is now ZendNevs, with PokeDinner as the compatibility option.
- ZendNevs was described as "only tested on Mario Kart World". The v2.0.5 notes also cover Donkey Kong Bananza and Pokopia startup.
- "3 builds in 1" means Eglantine build-104, PokeDinner and Selevet Eglantine merged into one build, not three separate executables.
- Mario Kart World: SmileyTatsu was the only first pick. ZendNevs now shares the pick because it documents about 56 FPS average. The results are not directly comparable: SmileyTatsu is a community claim, ZendNevs is a documented run on one PC.
- Pokopia: a tester suspected PokeDinner is not the best, but said they did not test it. The first pick stays notsapinho.

## Missing data

Most community reports do not include the GPU driver, game version or 1% lows. A row with `not stated` is incomplete, not a controlled result. Reports that only said "60 FPS" without a game or hardware were left out, as were messages about obtaining games or keys.
