# Donkey Kong Bananza notes

Reports from public community posts between 30 Oct and 5 Nov 2026, plus the Anka README published 6 Nov 2026. This page keeps the reports and workarounds that matter.

These are user reports, not benchmarks. A build that works on one GPU can show missing terrain, a purple screen or slow motion on another.

## What matters

- Game speed is tied to frame rate. Below 30 FPS the game runs in slow motion; above 30 it can run at double speed. The 30 FPS cap, slow mode, PokeDinner 2.5's 30 FPS option, or the DynamicFPS mod are the workarounds.
- DynamicFPS is a separate mod made by ZendNevs (DynamicFPS.-DonkeyKong-Bananza v1.1). It fixes the speed changes for some users but not all, and one user notes it needs the matching game update.
- Selevet performance build 3 and 4 are popular with a 30 FPS cap. One 5700X3D and RTX 5070 Ti user got 30 FPS with 60 FPS smooth motion, at the default 0.5x resolution; 1x also worked.
- PokeDinner 2.5 with the 30 FPS option was the best result for one Ryzen 5 9600X and RX 6800 user: no glitches, smooth frame rate and correct speed.
- ZendNevs v2.0.3 was called the best AMD build by one user, and v2.0.5 got positive comments. The repo has only 2 commits and no license, so treat its release-note results as self-reported. Recent independent reports favor Selevet perf 3/4 and PokeDinner 2.5.
- Terrain is a known AMD problem. OpenGL renders no terrain, Vulkan renders it but crashes more. PokeDinner, Zortos and Selevet differ in how much terrain they show.
- Purple screen: press down on the d-pad or enter Photo Mode and go back. Some builds fixed the purple screen; the latest SmileyTatsu build still showed it for one user.
- Build 204's d-pad fix caused continuous stutters and black texture flicker for one AMD user. PokeDinner 2.5 was the fallback.
- Fast and accurate differ. Accurate is around 30 FPS; fast reaches 40-50 FPS but can remove or break visual detail.
- Resolution: Selevet defaults to 0.5x and accepts 1x. One user ran 2x scale with SMAA and got 30 FPS in the open, 60 in tunnels.
- Memory: early builds leaked and hit OOM, especially the Zortos fork. 16 GB is the practical floor, 32 GB is safer.

## Fork notes

- At first, the game only booted on PokeDinner, with black textures and missing terrain.
- Zortos build 31 gave full AMD textures but only 20-25 FPS on an RX 6900 XT and had a memory leak. A 5700X3D and RTX 5070 Ti user hit 17 FPS looking north.
- Selevet performance 3 and 4 became the stable pick for several users, especially with the 30 FPS cap and smooth motion.
- ZendNevs v2.0.3 was called the best AMD build by one user, and v2.0.5 got positive comments. Its repo has 2 commits and no license; treat the release-note numbers as self-reported.
- Anka, a new Windows performance fork, reports 42-53 FPS uncapped and 39-46 FPS with the dynamic frame rate patch on a Ryzen 7 5700X and RTX 4060 Ti, against 17.3 FPS for PokeDinner 2.0.0 in the heaviest view. This is one PC and one game, not a controlled A/B; there are no independent reports yet.
- PokeDinner 2.5 with the 30 FPS option was the cleanest result for one full AMD system.
- Build 202 and 204 had purple-screen, texture and stutter reports. Keep a known-good build.

## Known issues

- Missing or invisible terrain on AMD, especially with OpenGL.
- Purple screen on some builds; Photo Mode or d-pad down can clear it.
- Game speed follows FPS; 30 FPS cap or DynamicFPS is required for normal speed.
- Build 204's d-pad fix introduced stutters and black texture flicker for one user.
- Build 212 can crash on GPU Fast during the first cutscene and at random when switching from Accurate. One Ryzen 7 3700X and RTX 3060 user on Arch Linux reported it.
- Orchid on an RX 6950 XT works but freezes occasionally; one user preferred it to ZendNevs on Linux.
- Memory leaks and OOM on early builds and the Zortos fork.
- Frame drops during destruction and in large rooms, even though standing still is fine.
- Some users see 60 FPS in tunnels or small rooms and 20-30 FPS in open areas, so area matters more than the average.
